	<h1>A Brief History of Hunter "HCJS" Silvestri</h1>
	<br/>
	<p>Hunter Silvestri was born in fire, and in death. Billions of years ago a star went supernova, and its last act was to bring Hunter into creation and to send him shooting across our miniscule universe. He was there as our sun spluttered into inferno, and as our planet began to turn. </p>
	<p>And finally, there was life. </p> 
	<p>There is life. </p>
	<p>You are life, and by extension, so is he. </p>
	<br/>
	<p>He lives in Rhode Island with his dog and trees. </p>
