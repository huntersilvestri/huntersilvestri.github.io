Hunter Silvestri
Tufts University
Ming Chow Comp. 20

This assignment includes an index file, a resume.html and a bio.html. It represents a rudimentary personal website.
As far as I know, all aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented.
I have discussed the assignment with Brendan Voelz '19 but not collaborated with anyone.

I spent around 6 hours working on this, but most of that was experimentation/trial&error rather than work on features I actually implemented.
