	<h1>A Brief History of Hunter "HCJS" Silvestri</h1>
	<p>Hunter Silvestri was born in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, on the 30th of May 1997. On no uncertain terms, he should not exist; his parents hated each other so much that his mother moved immediately to the other side of the country as soon as Hunter had fallen out of the womb. </p>
	<p>After relocating to Rhode Island as a newborn, Mr. Silvestri grew through an idellic and peaceful childhood at his mother's farm in the middle of a forest of christmas trees. He aspired to be a biologist until his hero Steve Irwin was stabbed through the heart by a sting ray, after which Mr. Silvestri wanted nothing to do with biology and turned wholeheartedly to writing and the visual arts. </p>
	<p>After writing his first book and recieving his first kiss in 2011 Mr. Silvestri considered himself finished and quietly retired. He lives in Wales with his wife and dog.</p>
